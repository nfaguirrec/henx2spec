# henx2spec

hex 2spec (He<sub>n</sub>@X2-->spectrum) is a software package designed to calculate the vib-rotational Raman spectrum of a homonuclear diatomic molecule immersed in a helium cluster. The two-photons Raman process can be summarized as follows:

![Terminal](doc/equation1.png)

The first photon with energy <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\hbar\omega_0"/> polarizes the system, inducing an electric dipole that allows the interaction with the electromagnetic radiation. Afterward, the system is excited to an intermediate state that eventually decays to a final state <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f"/> through the emission of a photon with energy <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\hbar\omega_{fi}"/>. Additionally, due to the system is weakly bonded, the absorbed energy can be enough to dissociate the aggregate following a process called "Vibrational Predissociation" which is directly related with the width of the bands in the final spectra.

To study this process the program uses the following system of coordinates:

# Execution of the program

```
$ HenX2Spec
Usage:
  $ HenX2_spec iFile T Jmax [JS] [JL] [LS] | [ALL]
```
First parameter is the input file, the second one is the temperature to be used to calculate the spectrum, and the third one is the maximum value of the angular momentum J to be considered. The other three parameters are optional and they allow to include the different kind of couplings. By default, the program will include ALL couplings.

Consider the following input file:
```
$ cat bosN4.inp
